### About me

Hello world. My name is Dale Ruppert and this is my Github account. 
I am currently at the Manitoba Institude of Trades and Technology learning how to become a software developer.

Outside of school, I am a 4th Degree Master in Tae Kwon Do with my own branch where I teach my students about the martial art I have loved for years.

I have coding experiance with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a bit of knowledge in Java.
